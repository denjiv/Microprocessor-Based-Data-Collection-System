# Microprocessor-Based-Data-Collection-System

# INTRODUCTION
The report presents the design a Remote data collection system that can be controlled by I2C protocols sent from a Local microcontroller that is then in turn controlled by a user on the PC through a RS232 connection. Test plans and specifications are then discussed, and results of the project are presented. The whole system consists of 2 major blocks: a Local Station and a Remote system. The system was designed so that multiple Remote Stations could be easily added and interfaced with the Local Station without much effort. Testing the system was made easy with the use of the Pickit 3 debugger tool and the logic analyzer. Overall, this project was a success and the requirements presented in the design specifications were met.

The goal of the lab is to design an environmental data collecting system, which supports bi-directional communications, based on PIC18F25K22 microcontrollers. The purposes of the lab is to practice and get familiar with microcontrollers and utilize the knowledge of SRAM. At the same time, I2C protocol and RS232 protocol are designed to support the bi-directional communication feature between those electronic components.
